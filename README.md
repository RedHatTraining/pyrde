This is a proof-of-concept Python library to format errors.

It is based on the [Reviewdog Diagnostic Format](https://github.com/reviewdog/reviewdog/tree/master/proto/rdf).

pyrde can:

* Generate text errors on the terminal.
* Generate CSV files with errors for statistical analysis.
* Generate [pull request comments](https://github.com/alexpdp7/pyrde/pull/1) using Reviewdog.

See [the example directory](example/) for an example.
